My feedback surrounds the importance placed on having a working demo before the hackathon and then not being able to demo in the presentation. Knowing this before would have potentially led to our team spending more time experimenting with the models than worrying about having our database and dashboard working for a demo. It was a personal choice our team made so maybe there is something to learn for us surrounding time management as it was also our first hackathon. Also would have been helpful to have a bit more clarity on the exact requirements for submission. There were a number of emails being sent to different people which had contradicting information which caused a minor amount of confusion.

Overall feedback...
- There was a lot of efforts to make it inclusive of different locations and timezones which was really appreciated. Still I know some people who getting up very early to present on the Friday though (e.g. multiple presentations at 7am to Greg). Catching up on recordings not always easy to find links to
- Biggest issue I heard was time commitment required which meant some didnt end up participating, or it was a stressful week. I noticed that teams where the Leaders really leaned in (encouraged teams to participate, reshuffled/paused other work) typically had better participation & engagement, less stress, as well as stronger submissions. 
- Commercial mentor role was limited - didnt have people show up to the sessions
- From marking it didnt seem like responses were truly ""generative AI"", more so modelling or automation
- For non-technical people I know there were a few who were keen to participate but not sure how, so I had a few discussions on this, but could make this clearer in comms

Overall AC has had a HUGE effort and I know many people greatly appreciated participating!",Time Commitment / Workload
