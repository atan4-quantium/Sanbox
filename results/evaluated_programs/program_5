I could not give my managers enough time to plan for 5 team members to be away for 3 days on the hackathon to re-direct client work and push back deadlines. We ended up creating a rotating schedule where only 2 team members were working on the hackathon on any given day of the three day event, and the rest were doing client work. Even the 2 team members had to spend time going to client meetings \/ doing other client work when they were meant to be on the hackathon. This lead to some very late nights and impacted how much we could deliver, and the quality of the final presentation, and a lot of exhaustion. If we had more time to warn our teams, perhaps 3 - 4 weeks, then it would have been easier to have an actual full 5-person team for the entire 3 days.",
