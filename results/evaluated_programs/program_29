I also heard from other team members who were more hands on that they learnt a huge amount through the process, hence my rating above. The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is because it was difficult to make the time around my day job, and I therefore had to catch up on work in my own time.",

The user acknowledges the value of the technical training and the learning experience, but highlights the difficulty in balancing the hackathon with their day job. This points to a challenge related to the time commitment and workload.",

The hackathon and gen ai were often lunch time topics of conversation which was a great way of engaging and learning. In the lead up to the day and during the hack it was great to brainstorm with my team, come up with new ideas and be able to test them out in a very hands on way, as well as to have the support of mentors and others in getting to a good technical outcome.",
